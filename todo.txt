Step2 - create a game very similar to the main timeline mode, but in a 3 * 3 two dimensional grid, based on the lat, long values, so the place the furthest north west goes in the top right corner and the place most south east goes in the bottom right corner

Bonus points if you can add a lttle compass on screen.
