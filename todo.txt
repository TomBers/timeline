Timeline is a game that challenges you to order historical events on a timeline, at the start of the game the player is allocated a series of random events, these are blocks and the user has to drag and drop them onto a timeline.  It is scored on how close they are to the correct order.  So for example if the timeline has 10 events it has 10 slots.  The events should be stored as a json file with a title, an image source description and a weblink.
